We proposed enhancement and diagnosis frameworks based on unsupervised multi-modal atlas mining and transfer cyclic feature learning. Developed methods including diversity-aware auto-focusing, kernel distillation focus, cross-modal virtual staining, achieving millisecond-level super-resolution imaging and in vivo pathological semantic transfer.<img src='/images/diagnosis.png'>
